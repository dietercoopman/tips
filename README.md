The seeder can take a while because of the creation of a huge posts table ( 150MB of data )

## hasMany tip ( route : /hasmany ) 

This tip is a reply on a question posted on Twitter regarding the fantastic ðŸ”¥ performance ðŸ”¥ tip by Laravel daily ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOnXX-N96NE )

I replied that retreiving only one field ( for example id ) will make the whereHas query faster, this is particulary the case on big tables, with a lot of columns and data.  This tip uses a posts table with 100 000 records and a lot of text data, the table is 150MB big.

If you're using ray it will output the queries to ray but it also outputs to clockwork.

This is the result of this tip , you can see that the query with one field selected on the whereHas query is as fast as the join equivalent
